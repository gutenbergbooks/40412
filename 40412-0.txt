    It would hardly be safe to name Miss Austen, Miss Brontë, and
    George Eliot as the three greatest women novelists the United
    Kingdom can boast, and were one to go on and say that the
    alphabetical order of their names is also their order of merit, it
    would be necessary to seek police protection, and yet surely it is
    so.

    Gray found very little gratification at Cambridge in the society
    and manners of the young university men who were his
    contemporaries. They ridiculed his sensitive temper and retired
    habits, and gave him the nickname of "Miss Gray," for his supposed
    effeminacy. Nor does Gray seem to have lived on much better terms
    with his academic superiors. He abhorred mathematics, with the
    same cordiality of hatred which Pope professed towards them, and
    at that time concurred with Pope in thinking that the best recipe
    for dullness was to

    Shelley had many merits and many defects. This is not the place
    for a complete or indeed for any estimate of him. But one
    excellence is most evident. His words are as flexible as any
    words; the rhythm of some modulating air seems to move them into
    their place without a struggle by the poet, and almost his
    knowledge. This is the perfection of true art.

    greater, too, was he than Socrates, in the range of his influence.
    In every department of his thinking--in his first philosophy, his
    theology, his physics, his psychology, his physiology--he sowed
    the dragon's teeth from which sprang hosts of armed men, to join
    in an intellectual conflict, internecine, let us trust, to their
    many errors and prejudices, but fraught with new life and energy
    to the intellectual progress of Europe.

    Samuel Pepys stands at the head of the world's literature in his
    own department.... Pepys' "_Diary_" has been frequently compared
    with Boswell's "_Life of Johnson_," and with justice in so far as
    the charm of each arises from the inimitable naïveté of the
    author's self-revelations. Boswell had a much greater character
    than his own to draw, but Pepys had to be his own Johnson. It is
    giving him no excessive praise to say that he makes himself as
    interesting as Johnson and Boswell together.... Another Milton is
    more likely to appear than another Pepys.

    In Nature there is no dirt, everything is in the right condition;
    the swamp and the worm, as well as the grass and the bird--all is

    Until after the war we had no real novels in this country, except
    "Uncle Tom's Cabin." This is one of the great novels of the world,
    and of all time. Even the fact that slavery was done away with
    does not matter; the interest in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," never will
    pass, because the book is really as well as ideally true to human
    nature, and nobly true. It is the only great novel of ours before
    the war that I can think of.

    When money represents many things, not to love it would be to love

    No surer does the Auldgarth bridge, that his father helped to

    which nothing can abolish.

    I think it will be generally conceded that, at the time of his
    death, Mr. Lowell occupied the position of the foremost American
    citizen. In public regard, at home and abroad, his name naturally
    headed the list of prominent Americans. Looked upon as a man of
    letters, as a representative of our country in foreign lands, or
    in any of the various positions in which he appeared before the
    public, there was no one to whom it was the custom to name James
    Russell Lowell as second. Without occupying the highest rank in
    any of his vocations, he stood in front of his fellow-citizens,
    because he held so high a rank in so many of them.

    There came a new poet who, to the science of rhythm, the resources
    of expression, the gift of epic narration, the deep feeling for
    nature, to all the caprices of a delightful fancy, to all the
    favorite ideas, noble or morbid, of modern thought, knew how to
    join the language of manly passion. Thus, as it were summing up in
    himself all his forerunners, he touched all hearts; he linked
    together all admirations; he has remained the true representative,
    the last expression and final, of the poetic period to which he
    belongs. Tennyson reigns to-day almost alone in increasing and
    uncontested glory.

    Thus, when a barber and a collier fight, the barber beats the

    the barber-red; black, red, and white, in various clouds are tost,
    and in the dust they raise the combatants are lost.

    hard to handle, and when caught, only to be cherished in slimy
    waters.

    All lies disgrace a gentleman, white or black, although I grant

    when you wish to deceive the enemy. Then, your duty to your
    country warrants your lying till you are black in the face; and,
    for the very reason that it goes against your grain, it becomes,
    as it were, a sort of virtue.

    Oh! say, can you see by the dawn's early light
  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?--
    Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the clouds of the fight
    O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming!
  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;

  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

    We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries:
    "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God
    never did"; and so, if I might be judge, God never did make a more

  His temper was of that warm susceptible kind which is caught
  with the heroic and the tender, and, which is more fitted to delight
  in the world of sentiment than to succeed in the bustle of ordinary
  life. This is a disposition of mind well suited to the poetical
  character, and, accordingly, all his earliest companions agree that
  Mr. Home was from his childhood delighted with the lofty and heroic
  ideas which embody themselves in the description or narrative of
  poetry.... Mr. Home's favorite amusement was angling.

    The drama is not ended. His voice is still heard. He is the poet of
    democracy--of all people. He is the poet of the body and soul. He

      How beautiful is night!
    A dewy freshness fills the silent air;
  No mist obscures; nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain,
    Breaks the serene of heaven:
    In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine
    Rolls through the dark blue depths;
      Beneath her steady ray
      The desert circle spreads
  Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.

    Among living authors Haggard is unquestionably first. I find two
    very remarkable qualities in Mr. Haggard's novels,--a power of
    imagination in which, for audacity and strength, he is unequalled
    since the Elizabethan dramatists. Secondly there is the mesmeric
    influence which he exercises over his readers.

    Shakespeare--that is, English tragedy--postulates the intense life
    of flesh and blood, of animal sensibility, of man and

    In the Confessions of St. Augustine, passion, nature,
    individuality only appear in order to be immolated to Divine
    grace. They are a history of a crisis of the soul, of a new birth,
    of a _Vita Nuova_; the Saint would have blushed to relate more
    than he has done of the life of the man, which he had quitted.
    With Rousseau the case is precisely the reverse; here grace is
    nothing, nature everything; nature dominant, triumphant,
    displaying herself with a daring freedom, which at times amounts
    to the distasteful--nay, to the disgusting.

    Equality is one of the most consummate scoundrels that ever crept
    from the brain of a political juggler--a fellow who thrusts his

    There is what I call the American idea.... This idea demands, as
    the proximate organization thereof, a democracy--that is, a
    government of all the people, by all the people, for all the
    people; of course, a government of the principles of eternal
    justice, the unchanging law of God: for shortness' sake I will
    call it the idea of Freedom.

    seige is finished and then summarily with preconceived ideas.

    Socrates, like Solon, thought that no man is too old to learn;
    that to learn and to know is not a schooling for life, but life

    appeared to both to be the real duty of man.

    Let the soldier be abroad if he will, he can do nothing in this
    age. There is another personage,--a personage less imposing in the
    eyes of some, perhaps insignificant. The schoolmaster is abroad,
    and I trust to him, armed with his primer, against the soldier in
    full military array.

    How few take time for friendship! How few plan for it! It is
    treated as a haphazard, fortuitous thing. May good luck send us
    friends; we will not go after them. May favoring fortune bind our
    friendships; we will take no stitches ourselves. Yet friendship
    requires painstaking. No art is so difficult, no craft so arduous.
    Roll a ball of clay and expect it to become a rose in your hand,
    but never expect an acquaintanceship, without care and thought, to
    blossom into friendship.

    Manners must adorn knowledge, and smooth its way through the

    I never yet heard man or woman much abused, that I was not

    When he writes of himself, how supremely excellent is the reading.
    It is good even when he does it intentionally, as in "Portraits
    and Memories." It is better still when he sings it, as in his
    "Child's Garden." He is irresistible to every lonely child who

    for only in it and in my dreams when I am touched with fever, do I
    grasp the long, long thoughts of a lonely child and a
    hill-wandering boy-thoughts I never told to any; yet which Mr.
    Stevenson tells over again to me as if he read them off a printed
    page.

  A life on the ocean wave!
    A home on the rolling deep,
  Where the scattered waters rave,

    Logic makes only one demand, that of science. But life makes a
    thousand. The body wants health; the imagination cries out for

    Peel was, undoubtedly, as Lord Beaconsfield has said, a great
    member of Parliament; but he was surely much more than that, he
    was a great statesman, a great Minister. He must always rank among
    the foremost of English Ministers. The proud boast of Heine is
    that, if any one names the best half-dozen of German poets his
    name must be brought among them. If we name the best half-dozen of
    modern English Prime Ministers, we can hardly fail to bring in the
    name of Peel.

    the gods. But he was cut off in his early prime, when his splendid
    genius was still in its dawn.

  Rising in clouded majesty, at length
  Apparent queen unveil'd her peerless light,
